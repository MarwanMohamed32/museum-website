              For the afterlife, sarcophagi decorated with garlands (floral
              wreaths) were common. Garlands were usually carried by
              mythological figures such as Dionysus and Herakles, both of whom
              symbolise the victory over death and eternal blessed life.

              Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus also known as Octavian (Latin:
              Octavianus), was the founder of the Roman Empire. He reigned as
              the first Roman emperor from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.[a]
              The reign of Augustus initiated an imperial cult, as well as an
              era associated with imperial peace (the Pax Romana or Pax Augusta)
              in which the Roman world was largely free of armed conflict aside
              from expansionary wars and the Year of the Four Emperors.

              to join Ra in the sky.
